# Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing Dataset #
Project Overview
This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Objective
The goal is to classify customers based on whether they will subscribe to a term deposit using various demographic and campaign-related features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. The dataset includes features such as:

Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, etc.)
Contact details (contact type, last contact duration, etc.)
Previous campaign outcomes
Social and economic indicators (employment variation rate, consumer confidence index, etc.)
Dataset Source
The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Structure

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-marketing-classifier.git
cd bank-marketing-classifier
Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook notebooks/decision_tree_classifier.ipynb
Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebook.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
Perform cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
